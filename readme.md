This repository is for random scripts and things that I want to keep for future uses and to store knowledge.

data_science_master contains some projects that I could save from the 2 year Masters Degree in Data science (the reason for this is that they were store in .ipynb format).

advent_of_code_2020 contains my attempts to follow up and solve that year advent of code but I was too lazy to continue
spending my freetime on that.
